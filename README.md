                  #NBA Team Stats Visualization HTML Page

The primary objective of this project is to develop an interactive HTML page that visualizes NBA team statistics for the past three years. By utilizing data from basketball-reference.com and stats.nba.com, we aim to provide valuable insights into team performances and individual player statistics, enabling users to make data-driven decisions.

Proposed Visualizations: Line Graphs: Display team performance trends over the past three years, allowing users to compare different teams. Bar Graphs: Present key performance metrics for each NBA team, making it easy for users to analyze statistical differences. Radar Charts: Showcase individual player statistics, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses in various categories.

Website Pages:

Cover Page: Introduce the purpose of the website, team logo, and a brief overview of the project. Individual Team Pages: Dedicated pages for each NBA team, featuring detailed line graphs and bar graphs to visualize team statistics. Player Pages: Pages displaying radar charts for each player, showcasing their individual performances.
